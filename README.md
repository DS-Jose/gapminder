Explore the evolution of global life expectancy and wealth dynamics from 1800 to 2018 through recreated single-year plots, an animated journey spanning 50 years using gganimate, and an interactive 2018 visualization with plotly, uncovering nuanced patterns and insights in the interplay between life expectancy, wealth, and global development.
